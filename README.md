## This repository is for practicing databases and unit tests. If I have time, I will practice and implement password hashing and other things.
### We haven't worked much with databases in school yet, and I'm using this repository to implement the concepts we've learned so far. I also plan to implement new things that I've learned elsewhere outside of school.
